## What I would do better
If I had more time I would do better:

* DnD of Modules and Lessons across Modules
    - I didn't work with react-beautiful-dnd before but I'm sure with little more time i could implement it 
* Separate API DTOs from Application data model and probably user normalzr to normalizr API response  (or discuss handler response with our BE)
* Implement error handling
* Move buttons to reusable components
* Add some CSS preprocessor (LESS?)
* Add svgr webpack loader from pertty svg components instead of hardcoded inline
* Write unit-tests
* Pay more attention to responsivness (did only basic version)
